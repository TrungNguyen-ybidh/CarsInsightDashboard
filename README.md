### CarsInsightDashboard
My car data dashboard is an interactive tool that helps users explore car pricing and key features like engine size and mileage. It allows users to filter data based on brand, year, and price, and view the results through various visualizations like scatter plots, Sankey diagrams, and bar charts. The backend uses a Flask API to handle data processing, while the frontend is built with Panel to make everything user-friendly and interactive. This setup makes it easy to dive into the data and get valuable insights quickly through visual analysis.
